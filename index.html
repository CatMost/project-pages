    <h2>What the what?</h2>
    <p>Thankful for the corona virus self quarentine to keep the
      world safer and suddenly with a surplus of time in my day I
      decided to set out on a mission in order to help with my feelings
      of stagnation (or lack of creation in my life).</p>
    <p>I have challenged myself to create something every week and complete a
      creation enough to post its project page here for all to see. Feel free to
      ping me if I have not posted in a week.</p>
