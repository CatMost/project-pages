    <h1>Catherine's Creation Challenge!</h1>
    <p>Thankful for the corona virus self quarentine to keep the
      world safer and suddenly with a surplus of time in my day I
      decided to set out on a mission in order to help with my feelings
      of stagnation (or lack of creation in my life).
      Projects for this challenge include (and will be updated weekly): </p>
    <ol>
      <!-- find better way to check off these items and track per week -->
      <li>(week one done!) create this website!</li>
      <li>create a data vis</li>
      <li>create drone video/photography</li>
      <li>design a tiny house for whidbey</li>
      <li>create chart (mapbox) of the ocean and migration patterns</li>
      <li>create interactive tide chart based on my fav locations</li>
      <li>more to come...</li>
    </ol>
    <!-- add in link to my personal website or a more "about me section" -->
